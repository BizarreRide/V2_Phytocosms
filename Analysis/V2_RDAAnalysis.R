# Description:
# This is an attempt for mutlivariate analyses of phytocosms from the phytocosms experiment of Valentina Sandor
# All measures are calculated as Differences between beginning and end of the experiment, i.e. changes

# Sample 11 has strange Cmic values compared to other replicates, see stacked bars in LoadData.R

# Soil ####        
## Z-transformation ####
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Here is an approach, that tries to handle negative values in some variables
# Since No3 is strictly negative, i just turn it into a positive variable
# Henc all changes are negative, but expressed as the absolute of the values
# this needs some time to think about, when looking at the PCA biplots

#soil$NO3 <- soil$NO3*(-1)

# In the next step i add the according minimum value to all variables, this leads to shift in the mesurement range
# of the minimum value, zeroes in the original measurements get that value.

#for (i in 1:6) {
#        na.action=na.omit(soil)
#        soil[,i] <- soil[,i] + abs(min(soil[,i], na.rm=TRUE))   
#}

# To achieve normal distributed variables, I calculate the log(x+1) of all values, 
# since there are still zeroes in the data

# soil.log <- log1p(soil)

# TO account for heterogeneity in the variances of the varaibles, i scale them 
# scaling before doing PCA is redundant, because rda(Scale=TRUE) can do this

#soil.z <- data.frame(scale(soil.log))

# All NAs get 0, in particular this refers to abundance and weights of soil organisms 
# [No weight = zero weight????]

#soil.z[is.na(soil.z)] <- 0

# However, without caring for multinormality:
# soil.z <- data.frame(scale(soil))
#  -> rda() can do this 
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

## Test for normal distribution ####

### Some Explanations of PCA Terms: ####
# Inertia: in vegan's language this is the term for "variation" in the data. This term comes from the word of CA (Sect. 5.4). 
# In PCA, the "inertia" is either the sum of the variances of the variables (PCA on a covariance matrix) or the sum of the diagonal values 
# of the correlation matrix (PCA on a correlation matrix), i.e. the sum of all correlations of the variables with themselves, 
# which corresponds to the number of variables.

# Constrained and unconstrained (constrained = gezwungen, abhÃ¤ngig): In PCA the  analysis is unconstrained and so are the results.

# Eigenvalues: symbolized as lambda, these are measures of the importance of an axis. By dividing them by the total inertia, they can be expressed as 
# Proportion explained / proportion of variation accounted for 

# Scaling: 1 = distance biplot: the eigenvectors are scaled to unit length. (1) Distances among objects in the biplot are approximations
# of their Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. (2) The angles among descriptor vectors are meaningless
#          2 = correlation biplot: ech eigenvector is scaled to the squareroot of the eigenvalue. (1) Distances among objects are not 
# approximations of their Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. (2) The angles between descriptors  in the biplot reflect their
# correlations

# Species scores: coordinates of the arrow heads of the variables. For historical rasons response variables are always calles "species" in vegan

# Site scores: coordinates of the sites in the ordination diagram. Objects are always called "Sites" in vegan output files.

### Biplots ####
eigenvalues <- soil.pca$CA$eig
evplot(eigenvalues) # One interprets only the axes whose eigenvalues are larger than the length of corresponding piece of the sticks

cleanplot.pca(soil.pca, ahead=0)

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
biplot(soil.pca, scaling=1,  main="PCA - Scaling 1")
pcacircle(soil.pca)
biplot(soil.pca, scaling=2,  main="PCA - Scaling 2")

#### Interpretation ####
# The Proportion of variance accounted for by the first two axes is 0.7375 or 73.8% This high value makes us confident 
# that our interpretation of the first pair of axes extracts most relevant information from the data. 

# First, the scaling 1 biplot displays a feature that must be explained. The circle is called a circle of equilibrium contribution. Its radius is equal to sqrt(d/p), 
# where d is the number of axes represented in the biplot (usually d=2) and p is the number of dimensions of the PCA space (i.e. the number of variables of the data matrix,
#                                                                                                                          6 in this case)
# The radius of this circle represents the length of the vector representing a variable that contributes equally to all the dimanesions of the PCA space. Therefore, 
# for any given pair of axis the variables that have vectors longer than this radius make a higher contribution than average and can be interpreted with confidence.

# The top right quarter of the scaling 1 biplot shows Microcosms with the highest values for pH, C and N content of the soil
# Ther is a gradient from topleft to buttom right qarter, The gradient displays Microcosms with either high
# values for No3 (topleft) of high values of NH4 (buttomright). The buttom right Microcosms have the highest values for both cmic and NH4, 
# And also the lowes values of NO3. Keep in Mind, that No3 was multiplicated with -1 prior to analysis.

# The scaling 2 biplot shows, that variables NO3 and nH4 are highly negatively correlated, as well as Cmic and No3. N, C and pH have nearly othogonal arrows indicating 
# a correlation close to 0.
