# Inertia: in vegan's language this is the term for "variation" in the data. This term comes from the word of CA (Sect. 5.4). 
# In PCA, the "inertia" is either the sum of the variances of the variables (PCA on a covariance matrix) or the sum of the diagonal values 
# of the correlation matrix (PCA on a correlation matrix), i.e. the sum of all correlations of the variables with themselves, 
# which corresponds to the number of variables.

# Constrained and unconstrained (constrained = gezwungen, abhÃ¤ngig): In PCA the  analysis is unconstrained and so are the results.

# Eigenvalues: symbolized as lambda, these are measures of the importance of an axis. By dividing them by the total inertia, they can be expressed as 
# Proportion explained / proportion of variation accounted for 

# Scaling: 1 = distance biplot: the eigenvectors are scaled to unit length. (1) Distances among objects in the biplot are approximations
# of their Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. (2) The angles among descriptor vectors are meaningless
#          2 = correlation biplot: ech eigenvector is scaled to the squareroot of the eigenvalue. (1) Distances among objects are not 
# approximations of their Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. (2) The angles between descriptors  in the biplot reflect their
# correlations

# Species scores: coordinates of the arrow heads of the variables. For historical rasons response variables are always calles "species" in vegan

# Site scores: coordinates of the sites in the ordination diagram. Objects are always called "Sites" in vegan output files.
