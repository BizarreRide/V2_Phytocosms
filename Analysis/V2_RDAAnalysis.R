## Some Explanations of PCA Terms: ####
# Inertia: in vegan's language this is the term for "variation" in the data. This term comes from the word of CA (Sect. 5.4). 
# In PCA, the "inertia" is either the sum of the variances of the variables (PCA on a covariance matrix) or the sum of the diagonal values 
# of the correlation matrix (PCA on a correlation matrix), i.e. the sum of all correlations of the variables with themselves, 
# which corresponds to the number of variables.

# Constrained and unconstrained (constrained = gezwungen, abhÃ¤ngig): In PCA the  analysis is unconstrained and so are the results.

# Eigenvalues: symbolized as lambda, these are measures of the importance of an axis. By dividing them by the total inertia, they can be expressed as 
# Proportion explained / proportion of variation accounted for 

# Scaling: 1 = distance biplot: the eigenvectors are scaled to unit length. (1) Distances among objects in the biplot are approximations
# of their Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. (2) The angles among descriptor vectors are meaningless
#          2 = correlation biplot: ech eigenvector is scaled to the squareroot of the eigenvalue. (1) Distances among objects are not 
# approximations of their Euclidean distances in multidimensional space. (2) The angles between descriptors  in the biplot reflect their
# correlations

# Species scores: coordinates of the arrow heads of the variables. For historical rasons response variables are always calles "species" in vegan

# Site scores: coordinates of the sites in the ordination diagram. Objects are always called "Sites" in vegan output files.

# Interpretation ####
# The Proportion of variance accounted for by the first two axes is 0.7375 or 73.8% This high value makes us confident 
# that our interpretation of the first pair of axes extracts most relevant information from the data. 

# First, the scaling 1 biplot displays a feature that must be explained. The circle is called a circle of equilibrium contribution. Its radius is equal to sqrt(d/p), 
# where d is the number of axes represented in the biplot (usually d=2) and p is the number of dimensions of the PCA space (i.e. the number of variables of the data matrix,
#                                                                                                                          6 in this case)
# The radius of this circle represents the length of the vector representing a variable that contributes equally to all the dimanesions of the PCA space. Therefore, 
# for any given pair of axis the variables that have vectors longer than this radius make a higher contribution than average and can be interpreted with confidence.

# The top right quarter of the scaling 1 biplot shows Microcosms with the highest values for pH, C and N content of the soil
# Ther is a gradient from topleft to buttom right qarter, The gradient displays Microcosms with either high
# values for No3 (topleft) of high values of NH4 (buttomright). The buttom right Microcosms have the highest values for both cmic and NH4, 
# And also the lowes values of NO3. Keep in Mind, that No3 was multiplicated with -1 prior to analysis.

# The scaling 2 biplot shows, that variables NO3 and nH4 are highly negatively correlated, as well as Cmic and No3. N, C and pH have nearly othogonal arrows indicating 
# a correlation close to 0.
